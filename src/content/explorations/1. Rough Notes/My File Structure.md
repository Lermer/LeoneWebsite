Tag Structure (for now)

Core tag categories

These cover almost everything without forcing premature specificity.

## 1. #Person 

Use for anyone human. No professions.

If profession matters, it goes in the note body, not the tag.

## 2. #Work 

Any discrete created thing.

Examples
Book
Film
Album
Essay
Artwork

You can optionally nest later if Obsidian supports it cleanly, but start flat.

## 3. #Place 

Any physical or geographic location.

## 4. #Concept

This is important, but tightly scoped.

Use only for named or established ideas, not your original thinking.

Examples
Panopticon
Zettelkasten
Fluxus

## 6.  #Event

Something that happened at a time.

Examples

Exhibition
Conference
Historical event
Performance

## 7. #Thing

Useful for non-creative, non-text things.

Examples

Tool Object Technology Medium

Good for cameras, software, instruments, materials.
