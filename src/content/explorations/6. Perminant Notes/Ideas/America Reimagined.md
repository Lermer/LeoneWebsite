## The Motivation

When did America become so set in stone? 

For a long time I have been frustrated with the feeling that the United States has lost it's ability to adapt to meet the needs the American people. No new amendments to the constitution have been added in my lifetime, while the ERA sits unratified, leaving the rights or millions of Americans' at the mercy of whichever party current holds power. 

Our representation doesn't represent us. 
The electoral collage is flawed.
The Senate gives disproportionate power to smaller states.
4 million U.S. citizens in U.S. Territories lack representation.
The two party system has become polarized to the point of ineffectual.

## The Idea

All of this frustration has made me think, what if I made series of art, or an installation that portrays  imagined America of the future. Not a perfect utopia. Nothing hyper futuristic and distant.

Could representing mundane artifacts from the future make change feel less impossible?

### Potential Subject Matter

1. A children's test asking them what year the ERA finally passed and what year term limits for supreme court were first enacted. 
2. A US map with borders redrawn based on [A New Map for America](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/opinion/sunday/a-new-map-for-america.html)
3. A ranked choice ballot

## Quotes

"The question Whether one generation of men has a right to bind another, seems never to have been started either on this or our side of the water… (But) between society and society, or generation and generation there is no municipal obligation, no umpire but the law of nature. We seem not to have perceived that, by the law of nature, one generation is to another as one independant nation to another…

On similar ground it may be proved that no society can make a perpetual constitution, or even a perpetual law. The earth belongs always to the living generation…"
